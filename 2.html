							<p>
								The module took 12 weeks of time, and the goal was to obtain knowledge about Network and Information Security Management (NISM). 
								To achieve this goal some individual tasks, but mainly group tasks were given to us, so we can learn key elements of NISM.
							</p>
							<p>
								To successfully manage all of this, it was key to grow as a team as well as to grow individually. While in the early weeks we 
								were getting to know each other and simply figured out who is best at what task, we could at the end of the project naturally work 
								in the areas where everyone was known to be best at and develop in areas, we lacked some skills. Group communication 
								(<a href="2_minutes.html">#minutes</a>), dynamics and performance (<a href="2_artefacts.html#9">#9</a>) were extraordinary at any time during the module. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Since I had some pen-testing skills prior to this seminar, which I got confirmed by peers and tutors by presenting about tools and 
								discussing them in seminar 3 (<a href="2_artefacts.html#7">#7</a>), I got the role of pen-tester assigned in the group. I therefore added mainly technical input such 
								as tools we plan to use, strategy and methodology to the design document (<a href="2_artefacts.html#8">#8</a>). 
								Scanning and pen-testing a website looked easy at first glance to me, since the html & CSS code as well as basic scans 
								(<a href="2_artefacts.html#4">#4</a>, <a href="2_artefacts.html#5">#5</a>, <a href="2_artefacts.html#12">#12</a>) revealed some outdated software having many 
								CVEs associated. While following up on this large number on vulnerabilities I started to realize, that the main part of the work is not to find potential 
								ways in, but to verify if they are exploitable and lead to a way in.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also had a very good chance to learn about new tools we got suggested, such as Pacu. We used Pacu at the end of our planned testing phase and 
								we were quite exhausted at that time. Nonetheless the positive group dynamic led to the fact that we maintained our persistence. The goal was to 
								find the first exploit, which we then finally managed to identify. This made me realize that success with pen-testing does not only come with a 
								carefully crafted workflow and a mixture of automated tools and manual effort, it also about teamwork and the positive stubbornness to never give up. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Another key piece of learning was the fact that progressing in hacking is based on the fact, that you must be auto didactive. In a rapidly fast 
								changing environment such as cyber security, it is key to learn about the latest methods, exploits and tools. Since the latest knowledge is not 
								prepared in a well-established manner, it is important to be able to nonetheless digest it so you can adapt it to your problem.
							</p> 
							<p>
								Also important to mention is, that every industry has different regulations it needs to adhere to. Knowledge about this could be trained in 
								assignments (<a href="2_artefacts.html#13">#13</a>, <a href="2_artefacts.html#14">#14</a>). This information as well as the findings went into 
								our final document (<a href="2_artefacts.html#16">#16</a>). Part of the final report was also suggesting mitigation for threats we found.
							</p>
							<p>
								Comparing the design proposal and the final project I must state that the plan did not differ to much from what we reported. I however also must 
								mention, that pen-testing a cloud hosted web application, is quite a huge task. I realized that even the web application has some many angles to 
								be attacked, that a more fine-grained methodology such as the OWASP methodology should better be applied next time. I also would start as many 
								automated scans as possible in the beginning and select manual investigations more carefully next time. Additionally, I would also distribute the 
								manual task via a structured plan to team members to avoid duplicate work.
							</p>
							<p>
								In conclusion I can state that I learned to identify security risks by analysing how threat actors might exploit vulnerabilities and how to 
								successfully mitigate them appropriately. I learned how to design and configure cloud applications, so that they withstand attacks. I learned 
								to gather information on the threat landscape to analyse security incidents. I also learned on how to pass this information along to a specific 
								target group, so they will understand the matter. I gained all his knowledge not only be reading, but more importantly by actively doing it 
								myself by e.g., pen-testing a website and taking part in group discussions. This first-hand knowledge not only sunk in deeper, but it also provides 
								a very valuable perspective on things (further evidence not mentioned prior to show my key learnings can also be found 
								here <a href="2_artefacts.html#1">#1</a>, <a href="2_artefacts.html#2">#2</a>, <a href="2_artefacts.html#3">#3</a>, 
								<a href="2_artefacts.html#6">#6</a>, <a href="2_artefacts.html#10">#10</a>, <a href="2_artefacts.html#11">#11</a>, <a href="2_artefacts.html#15">#15</a>)
							</p>
							<p>
								Brumley (2018) states that creative problem-solving skills, untiring persistence, and the fact someone is auto didactive is key to become successful 
								at hacking. Since those skills are my natural strengths, it will be likely that I will have a great future in cyber security. I although must state, 
								that there might be other factors important to excel in cyber security, that were not reported by Brumley (2018), which I also have not discovered 
								yet. Currently however I can say that I have found my passion in pen-testing, since my natural strengths seem to be key factors to be successful in 
								this area. Having realized this, helped me to identify my main target for this masterâ€™s degree, which I will also pursue in my professional career. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Since I also identified first-hand during this module that cyber security is not only a very broad, but also deep topic, I have identified many 
								areas for improvement (<a href="/pdf/2/Professional_Skills_Matrix.pdf" target="_blank">#professional skills matrix</a>, <a href="pdf/2/Action_Plan.pdf" target="_blank">#action plan</a>) 
								to achieve my goal.
