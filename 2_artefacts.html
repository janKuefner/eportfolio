							I used the four main pillars (continuous and timely updates, filtering of traffic, intrusion detection and encryption) of network security 
							as proposed by Ross (2008) to ensure I had a solid initial post. Many fellow students added good examples supporting the four pillars, but 
							one student mentioned training, which isn’t covered by the model. I therefore added a 5th pillar to the model of Ross (2008) for me personally.  <br>
							Also reading other post made me realize, that my view was very focused on modern day devices, whilst the reality is, that a network can and 
							even sometimes must host older devices. I then realized that a hardened network is not just one additional layer of defense, it might well 
							be the only layer of defense. This observation influenced my summary post, too.<br>

							The instructions to set up the website nonetheless had the following security faux paxs:
							<ul>
								<li>http instead of https</li>
								<li>open SSH port, which isn’t strictly necessary, since server configuration can be done via AWS backend.</li>

							Team effort was great during this exercise. We had a very lively team chat, that helped with the investigation of results and with

							The exercise was great, since I learned that trace routing Amazon Web Services (AWS) is more complex than I thought. I read a lot 
							about network protocols to resolve issues encountered, which gave me a thorough understanding of those protocols. The spirit of our 
							group was great. We had a very positive competition, which even motivated me to do further work.<br>

							<a href=pdf/2/Team_Nebula_-_Seminar_2_Presentation.pdf target="_blank">Team Nebula - Seminar 2 Presentation</a><br>
							<br>
							After reading the article and prior seminar I had many arguments showing that ISO/OSI would have been worse than TCP/IP. My main point of the argument 
							prior seminar was that many tools (PHP, MySQL, Apache, Firefox, …)  could only be coded, since the TCP/IP standard had working implementations at the 
							core, the open-source community could easily build on. <br>
							The seminar showed that my main conclusion was correct. TCP/IP was superior to ISO/OSI. Doug, our tutor added on my main argument by stating that 
							ISO/OSI planned to sell costly licenses, which would have been likely to hinder a lot of good open-source software to be created. The internet as 
							we know it now, would be different, if ISO/OSI would have prevailed.<br>

							This presentation was primarily done by other team members, so a part of our team including me could focus on the pen-testing activities in
