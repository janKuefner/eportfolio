								Team meetings: none within this module<br>
								Tutor meetings: My tutor explained the use of use case diagrams and sequence diagrams for OOP secure programming.
								Feedback: see artefacts

							<h2>Reflective peace</h2>
							<p>
								We did have two great discussions. The first one was about why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security. The second one was about security technologies and the context in which they can be employed. Both discussion helped to build knowledge in the area of cyber security not only by starting the discussion with the initial post, but also by responding to peers. Depending on how far the discussion was proceeded, sometimes deep research was necessary to add something to the discussion. This interactive approach was very beneficial to get deep technical knowledge as well as an overview.
								<br><br>We also had to do an essay. The essay was about a very realistic situation. We had to outline a web based scheduling system for a hospital and discuss the cyber security issues and their mitigation. This helped me to apply the knowledge gained in the discussion but also challenged me again to complete my knowledge on threats and mitigation. Due to the task assignment, we had to approach it methodical, which is great, since day to day work does do lack knowledge on methods in general.
								<br><br>At the end we had to code in Python. I chose to code ...
