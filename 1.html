											<p>
											Due to various great contributions from fellow students enhancing my initial post, 
											the question why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important to invest 
											in Cyber Security could be thoroughly elaborated.
											</p>
											<p>
											Discussing a medical device company helped to point out, that fines imposed by regulations 
											such as HIPAA and GDPR are a strong motivator to invest in Cyber Security for companies 
											in general. This is because fines are in the millions of Euros and therefore can even hurt
											the biggest companies regardless of the sector they are operating in (Ritzar and Filkina, 2019), 
											(Alder 2021). During the discussion it was also identified, that Artificial Intelligence (AI)
											as a new technology might tempt companies to retain data to train their algorithms. This 
											however can be in violation with a regulation such as GDPR, where data of an individuum 
											may only be kept for a limited time. An attack revealing such data was leaked, would likely 
											to result in fines not only for insecure storage but additionally also for data processing  
											beyond its permissible purpose (GDPR 2016). 
											</p>
											<p>
											Additionally it was argued, that AI also might be used to attack in the future, since AI 
											is likely to develop smart algorithms, that will be very dynamic and hard to anticipate 
											(Tschider 2018). Building up a defence to such a threat scenario will be challenging and 
											according to Creese et al. (2020) a global approach is necessary to develop effective tools 
											to defend.
											</p>
											<p>
											Ironically AI could on the other hand also be used to prevent attacks from happening by 
											monitoring relevant big data generated within a company such as e.g. traffic. AI could be 
											able to monitor the traffic of a large cooperation and could identify patterns, that could 
											point to the fact that e.g. account credentials are abused (Budek 2020).
											</p>
											<p>
											During the debate it was agreed, that skipping cyber security is only beneficial for some 
											companies (Williams 2019). In particular it might only be good for companies, that need to 
											provide evidence fast, that their business model will generate revenue. For the majority of 
											companies however it is more beneficial to invest in cyber security from the beginning. For 
											a medical device company in particular, it was argued, that loss of availability and integrity 
											might lead to harm of patients, which makes cyber security a topic that cannot be skipped. 
											(Pesapane et al. 2108)
											</p>
											<p>
											That quantum computing will render current encryption ineffective was not in dispute, but 
											quantum computing still needs some time to be broadly available (Lichfield 2020)(Stolbikova 2016). 
											AI on the other hand was seen as a technology that can shift the threat landscape in the near 
											future to a very dynamic scenario. 
											</p>
											<p>
											In conclusion it can be stated, that AI and hefty fines imposed by regulations can be seen as 
											strong motivators for companies to now invest in cyber security.

											<p>Contributions to the discussion helped to get an overview of methods capable of securing a network and to discuss the pro and cons of some of the individual solutions in detail.</p>

											<p>To minimise the attack surface of a network, filtering traffic via firewalls was agreed to be a must have, although firewalls cannot mitigate all threats. (Ross 2008)</p>

											<p>It was of no dispute, that antivirus (AV) software is an effective tool for intrusion detection and therefore should also be a key element of your defence strategy. Other tools are however also available here. (Ross 2008; Koret &amp; Bachaalany 2015)</p>

											<p>It was also mentioned that an additional element to your defence should be encryption, because if the first two measures fail, the attacker now still needs to decrypt your data, which if done right, is not economic for most attackers. (Mustafa et al 2015)</p>

											<p>Updating systems was only touched by the discussion but was also seen as a key element of any defence strategy. (Ross 2008)</p>

											<p>Bottom line the discussion pointed out that every technology has its pros and cons. The implementation of most security features will always be a trade of between factors such as money, security, performance, and usability. A recommendation on the ideal set up therefore cannot be given, since the best solution is very case depending. If you take firewalls for example, it can be said that large cooperation with high value assets will have a very different firewall landscape, than a home network. (Ross 2008)</p>

											<p>The technology also does have its limitation. Although present-day signature scanning of AV software is very complex, they still cannot detect most of the unknown malware (i.e., Zero-day attacks) (Suttard &amp; Pinto 2011). This is however not an argument to not deploy certain tools, it is rather an argument to have as many effective tools within your layered defence as economically achievable.</p>

							<h2>Meeting Notes</h2>
							<p>
								It’s essential to keep a record of what your team’s activities in line with the guidelines set out on teamwork 
								(see the Department of Computing page).  You should also record outcomes of any meetings with your tutor and as 
								well as feedback you have received.
							</p>
							<h2>Reflective peace</h2>
							<p>
								We did have two great discussions. The first one was about why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security. The second one was about security technologies and the context in which they can be employed. Both discussion helped to build knowledge in the area of cyber security not only by starting the discussion with the initial post, but also by responding to peers. Depending on how far the discussion was proceeded, sometimes deep research was necessary to add something to the discussion. This interactive approach was very beneficial to get deep technical knowledge as well as an overview.
								<br><br>We also had to do an essay. The essay was about a very realistic situation. We had to outline a web based scheduling system for a hospital and discuss the cyber security issues and their mitigation. This helped me to apply the knowledge gained in the discussion but also challenged me again to complete my knowledge on threats and mitigation. Due to the task assignment, we had to approach it methodical, which is awesome, since day to day work does do lack knowledge on methods in general.
								<br><br>At the end we had to code one of the proposed mitigation in Python an MySQL, which is perfect to round it up, since we now not only have theoretical knowledge on cyber security, but also some hands on experience on coding mitigations.
